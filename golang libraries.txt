We have  collected a list of Golang resources on Machine Learning libraries & categorized it based on various algorithms & approaches!

Generalized Machine Learning Libraries:

GoML - https://github.com/cdipaolo/goml - On-line Machine Learning in Go that includes libraries for Generalized Linear Models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression etc), Perceptron, Clustering (K Means, K Nearest Neibhours...) & Text Classification (Multinomial & term frequency...)

Machine Learning libraries for Go Lang : https://github.com/alonsovidales/go_ml: Implemented Algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Collaborative Filtering & Gaussian Multivariate Distribution for anomaly detection systems

MLGo - https://code.google.com/p/mlgo/ - Algorithms implemented include Gaussian mixture model, k-means, k-medians, k-medoids, single-linkage hierarchical clustering

GoLearn: - GoLearn is a 'batteries included' machine learning library for Go. Simplicity, paired with customisability, is the goal.

Neural Networks

Neural Networks written in go : https://github.com/goml/gobrain

Go Fann - https://github.com/white-pony/go-fann - Go bindings for FANN, library for artificial neural networks

https://github.com/schuyler/neural-go - Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network

Genetic Algorithms library written in Go / golang - https://github.com/thoj/go-galib

Word2Vec, GloVe in Go : https://github.com/ynqa/wego

Linear Algebra:

Linear Algebra for Go & Matrix Library:

Mat64: Package mat64 provides basic linear algebra operations for float64 matrices. mat64 provides a set of concrete types that implement different classes of matrices (Dense, Symmetric, etc.) and operations on them. In most cases, an operation which results in a matrix value is a method on the value being produced.

BLAS Implementation for Go: The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations

https://github.com/danieldk/golinear - liblinear bindings for Go

https://github.com/james-bowman/sparse - Sparse matrix formats for Go

Decision Trees:

Hector https://github.com/xlvector/hector - Golang machine learning lib. Currently, it can be used to solve binary classification problems.Logistic Regression , Factorized Machine , CART, Random Forest, Random Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree & Neural Network

Decision Trees in Go - https://github.com/ajtulloch/decisiontrees - Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, etc. implemented in Go

CloudForest - https://github.com/ryanbressler/CloudForest - Fast, flexible, multi-threaded ensembles of decision trees for machine learning in pure Go (golang). CloudForest allows for a number of related algorithms for classification, regression, feature selection and structure analysis on heterogeneous numerical / categorical data with missing values.

Bayesian Classifiers:

https://github.com/jbrukh/bayesian - Perform naive Bayesian classification into an arbitrary number of classes on sets of strings.
